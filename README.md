# HAPS - Healthcare Advanced Protection System

HAPS is a real-time patients monitoring system that monitors patients' vital signs
using IoT smart gadgets (similar to smartwatches) attached to patients' wrists and sends
the data to the cloud server through a socket.

This repository contains the HAPS' Mobile Application which is created with flutter.
with this app, the treatment staff in a hospital or a clinic can monitor their 
supervision patients' status and get alerted when a critical situation happens.

This was my and my collaborators' IoT course final project and i was the mobile app
developer.
